We can use the table of different rating ids for the gui with a way
to check multiple boxes for aggregation of each id into a 'hash'

1 - too long
2 - wrong time of day
3 - too many hard classes in a quarter
4 - too many major courses in a quarter
5 - too few classes per quarter
6 - good
7 - unacceptable
8 - too many courses in a quarter
9 - too many electives
10 - incorrect plan
 yada yada, need to finish this table get the information from the other individuals

Talk to likita (sp_)
She has like 10000 observations, and she does this generation based on existing plans.
Extrapolate metrics from this and doesn't even need to look at the plans.

This is based on summer no summer, number of ___ and such
feature vectors is what she uses.

Ranks plans based on the metric provided by a certain plan. This is important for our
generation and rating of data. This is based on a formula. Okay then, this is going to be
a good way to validate our rankings generated manually.

A schedule can be seen as a very constrained language.
If we view these as regular expressions we may be able to create constraints
that generates schedules in our alphabet...
Tokens, statements. Is a schedule a statement or a token.

We should have math 0 before 1, how can we describe these complex sequences in a simple
alphabet such as regex...?
